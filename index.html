      <h1>Built Exclusively for Small Business Owners</h1>
      
      <p>Get your own on-hand content production team, and let them build you a powerful online presence. </p>
      
      <p>We take all the drag out of nurturing your audience. </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Have an idea</li>
        <li>Add to the queue </li>
        <li>Watch it get results</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Your time is too precious to spend it producing the never ending stream of content needed to position your business as an authority. You have more important things to do. </p>
      
      <h2>Your Pod</h2>
      <p>You’ll have one content “pod”, which is an organized, discrete team. All pods are directed by a lead editor, and the rest typically includes two freelance writers and a designer. Your lead editor will get to know you and your audience over time, as will the writers. </p>
      
      <h2>Your Schedule</h2>
      <p>We’ve developed a slick process that delivers two great blog posts per week. All posts are well-researched and entertaining, complete with graphics, published strictly on-time. </p>
      
      <h2>Your Goals</h2>
      <p>The lead editor of your pod is also tasked with tracking your content’s performance out there in the wild. Your editor will probably get to know what your audience likes even better than you! Continuous improvement and optimization is inevitable with this system. </p>
